title: Privacy Academy 2024
---

Considering education and guidance towards practical and useful developments as necessary and of primary importance, Web3Privacy Now intends to develop and offer training, incubation, and acceleration programs.

All this will be done via 3 phases:

- LEARN - Academy & Mentorship
- BUILD - Cohort, Hackathons & Grants
- SCALE - Fundraising, Advisory, & Partnerships

## Goals

- **Create impactful privacy solutions**: ensure people avoid generating redundant or ineffective code.
- **Develop sustainable privacy projects**: transform hackathon demos into enduring, viable products.
- **Redirect misallocated funds to value-aligned stakeholders**: connect conscientious devs with experienced mentors and grant programs.

## Execution Plan

**PRIVACY ACADEMY**

Due to the lack of a single resource that provides a comprehensive understanding of:

- Why and how the internet is broken
- What blockchain and cryptography are and what was their initial purpose 
- How to protect yourself and take concrete action

# We have developed a multi-phase initiative:

- Milestone 1 [Q4 2024] - Curated Learning Resources We gather the best existing materials and curate them to be accessible for both average crypto users and total beginners. This empowers users to learn exactly what they are looking for or interested in and to implement best practices effectively.

- Milestone 2 [Q2 2025] - Structured Learning Paths We create various learning paths and playlists, and run cohort-based programs similar to kernel. These programs allow participants to interact with each other, to receive guidance from mentors and experts, and to enhance their learning experience.

- Milestone 3 [Q4 2025] - Project Accelerator and Post-Academy Support We launch an accelerator for final projects from the Academy learners and provide post-academy support and work introductions. Graduates will be able to publish their projects and ideas on our grant/bounty platform where they will find the opportunity to be funded or crowdfunded.

- Milestone 4 [Q1 2026] - Original Content Production We will start producing our own content in collaboration with our network and key experts to further enhance our educational offerings.
